## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learnt how to toggle class in JavaScript using the .classList.toggle() function. 
```js
function toggleMenu() {
    const menu = document.getElementById("menu");
    menu.classList.toggle("show");
};
```

I also learned how to edit SVGs in HTML/CSS (make them bigger and smaller in width and height).


### Continued development

I want to continue improving in my usage of JavaScript so i can be able to add animations to webpages.
